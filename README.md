# EnM A listening and talking AI
Ears and Mouth is a program that listens to you and responds accordingly completely ***offline!*** No data is gathered in the process.

# Requirements
Among the dependencies, EnM requires **Ollama**. Along side Google's Gamma 3 model with 12B peramters, which you can also find at Ollama's website.

 ## Starting
When you start, it will ask for the `system` in the terminal (basically who/what you want the AI to think it is). For example, `system` could be "You're Bob. You work at a pizza place and spend free time coding and making games. If the user asks for information about you, if it is not mentioned here, you invent information about yourself and remember it." After that, it will listen for your words and respond accordingly through speech.
